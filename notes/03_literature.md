## Programming

Recommended literature on the use of R is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), which is also available as a [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

## Bayesian data analysis

To cover our basics, we will read selected chapters from John Kruschke's [Bayesian Data Analysis](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/), 2nd edition of 2015.

Optional reading:

- Gelman, A., Carlin, J. B., Stern, H. S., & Rubin, D. B. ([2014](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/)). Bayesian data analysis (Vol. 2).
    - The classic reference, but a bit more mathy.
    

- Richard McElreath ([2016](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)) Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan.
    - Very inspiring and illuminating big-picture narrative.
    
## Cognitive Modeling

We will use selected chapters and exercises from Michael D. Lee and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers [Bayesian modeling for cognitive science](https://bayesmodels.com/)) from 2014.

Optional reading:

- Stephan Lewandowsky & Simon Farrell (2011) Conputational Modeling in Cognition: Principles and Practices. 
    - Great introduction to cognitive modeling in general with classic applications.
