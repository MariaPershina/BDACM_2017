## road map for today

<span style = "color:white"> &nbsp; </span>

- review: $p$-values & confidence intervals

<span style = "color:white"> &nbsp; </span>

- digest $p$-problems identified by Wagenmakers (2007)

<span style = "color:white"> &nbsp; </span>

- brief introduction to Rmarkdown & reproducible research


# $p$-values and confidence intervals

## wide-spread confusion

many statistical concepts are misunderstood by the majority of researchers

- Oakes (1986): $p$-values are misinterpreted all the time
- Haller & Kraus ([2002](https://www.metheval.uni-jena.de/lehre/0405-ws/evaluationuebung/haller.pdf)): also true for senior researchers and statistics teachers
- Hoekstra et al. (2014): the same holds true for confidence intervals

## quiz

<span style = "color:white"> &nbsp; </span>

1. $p$-values quantify subjective confidence that the null hypothesis is true/false
2. $p$-values quantify objective evidence for/against the null hypothesis
3. $p$-values quantify how surprising the data is under the null hypothsis
4. $p$-values quantify probability that the null hypothesis is true/false
5. non-significant $p$-values mean that the null hypothesis is true
6. significant $p$-values mean that the null hypothesis is false
6. significant $p$-values mean that the null hypothesis is unlikely

<div style = "position:absolute; top: 620px; right:60px;">
  which of these are true?
</div>

## $p$-values


sloppy version: the $p$-value (of a two-sided exact test) gives the probability, under the null hypothesis, of an outcome at least as unlikely as the actual outcome 

better version: the $p$-value is the probability of observing, under <span style = "color:firebrick">infinite hypothetical repetitions of the same experiment</span>, a less extreme value of a <span style = "color:firebrick">test statistic</span> than that of the oberved data, given that the null hypothesis is true

## example: fair coin?

- we flip $n=24$ times and observe $k = 7$ successes
- null hypothesis: $p = 0.5$

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
  
plotData = data.frame(x = 0:24, y = dbinom(0:24, 24, 0.5))
plotData2 = data.frame(x = c(0:7, 17:24), y = dbinom(c(0:7, 17:24), 24, 0.5))
sig.plot = ggplot(plotData, aes(x = x , y = y )) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", width = 0.35) +
  geom_bar(data = plotData2, aes(x = x, y = y), stat = "identity", fill = "darkblue", width = 0.35) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=dbinom(7,24,0.5)) + xlab("k") + ylab("B(k | n = 24, p = 0.5)") +
  # geom_text(data.frame(x = 3, y = 0.05, label = paste0("p = " , round(1-sum(dbinom(8:16, 24, 0.5)),3), collapse = "")), aes(x = x, y = y, label = label)) 
  geom_text(x = 3, y = 0.03, label = paste0("p = " , round(1-sum(dbinom(8:16, 24, 0.5)),3), collapse = ""))
sig.plot
```

## example: fair coin?

```{r}
binom.test(7,24)
```

## significance

fix a significance level, e.g.: $0.05$

<span style = "color:white"> &nbsp; </span>

we say that a test result is significant a $p$-value is below the pre-determined significance level

<span style = "color:white"> &nbsp; </span>

we reject the null hypothesis in case of significant test result

<span style = "color:white"> &nbsp; </span>

the significance level thereby determines the $alpha$-error of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis

- aka: type-I error / incorrect rejection / false positive



## confidence interval

the null hypothesis fixes a concrete value of some parameter (e.g., coin bias $p = 0.5$)

we have an experiment $E$ and we have a set of all possible outcomes $O(E)$ of that experiment

the observed outcome is $o^*$

consider a function $I \colon o \mapsto I_o$ mapping each possible outcome $o \in O(E)$ to an interval of relevant parameter values

this construction is a level-$(1-p)$ <span style = "color:firebrick">confidence interval</span> iff, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct, when we repeat the experiment infinitely often, the proportion of intervals $I_{o}$, associated with each outcome $o$ of a hypothetical repetition, that contain the the true parameter value is $1-p$

</div>

## what do we learn from a CI?

<span style = "color:white"> &nbsp; </span>

1. range of values we would not reject (at the given significance level)
2. range of values that would not make the data surprising (at the given level)
3. range of values that are most likely given the data
4. range of values that it is rational to belief in / bet on
5. that the true value lies in this interval
6. that the true value is likely in this interval
7. that, if we repeat the experiment, the outcome will likely lie in this interval

# $p$-problems

## 3 problems

<span style = "color:white"> &nbsp; </span>

1. $p$ depends on unobserved data
2. $p$ depends on subjective intentions 
3. $p$ does not quantify evidence
